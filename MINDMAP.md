# claude-red — Library Mindmap

A visual map of every skill in the library, by category. Use it to navigate, to discover skills you didn't know existed, and to spot coverage gaps before an engagement.

## How to Use the Mindmap

- **Pre-engagement:** Walk the relevant category branch and confirm a skill exists per surface in scope. Gaps you spot here are gaps in the engagement plan.
- **During engagement:** Click into the category for the surface you're testing; load only those skills into Claude.
- **Post-engagement:** Cross-check findings against the relevant Mindmap branches to ensure no surface was skipped.
